    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Research Student pursuing working towards my Ph.D degree on Image Caption Generation. 
      During my Ph.D I have studied Encoder-Decoder and Attention based Image Captioning approaches. 
      Apart from Image Caption Generation, my research interests lie in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques
      such as Machine Translation, Text Summarization, etc. 
      


education:
    - degree: Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering
      Institute: National Institute of Technology, Silchar, India
      time: 2015 - 2021
      details: |
        I have studied Image Caption Generation during my Ph.D with a focus on eficient utilization of semantic and visual information
        for Caption Generation. I have performed comparative analysis of methods proposed in previous works and proposed methods to address
        their limitations. Some of the works towards perusal of my Ph.D are listed below. This includes only published/accepted works.
          - To analyse role of image representation obtained from various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), I performed comparative
          analysis of different CNN architectures to study their efficacy for Image Caption Generation task. 
          - I have performed comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network based Decoder with the recently proposed Convolutional Decoder. 
          I have observed that Convolutional Decoder does not model long term word relationships efficiently.
          - I have proposed Encoder-Decoder and Visual Attention based Caption Generation methods using Contextual Word Embedding Representations for
          enhanced semantic information representation and Perspective Transforms as Data Augmentation mechanism for better exploitation of Visual information.
          In addition, I have used fine tuning of both CNN and Word embedding layers to obtain performance improvements.
          
        The tentative date of my thesis submission is 17th September, 2021.


    - degree: M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
      Institute: National Institute of Technology, Silchar, India
      time: 2013 - 2015
      details: |
        I have worked on Extractive Text Summarization during my M.Tech study. I have used lexical relationships among words to formulate improved method for 
        identification of sentences from the text which can be used as summary.
        
        
    - degree: B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
      Institute: National Institute of Technology, Silchar, India
      time: 2009 - 2013
      details: |
        During my time at NIT Silchar I learnt the basics of Computer Science and Engineering which have served as foundation over which I have continued my studies during M.Tech
        and Ph.D. I also learned skills such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time during B.Tech and learnt a lot which has helped me later in life.
        I spent my free time participating in Quiz Competitions. I also organized a Quiz Competition during annual College Fest. In addition, I served as committee member in 
        organizing teams of annual Alumni Meet and some technical competititions organized by Computer Science and Engineering Department.
